ingredients:
- 2 cups of masa harina (I typically use Maseca, but Bob's Red Mill or another brand will work)
- 1 tsp of salt (or to taste)
- 1.5 cups hot water
- 1 tsp olive oil or canola oil

additional items:
- non-stick griddle (my preference is to use a cast-iron griddle, either will work)
- plastic wrap OR
- clear kitchen towels
- large plastic storage bag
tortilla press OR
-cutting board and a heavy skillet or dish

directions:
- Add 2 cups of masa harina and salt in a large bowl. Mix together well with a spoon.
- Create a well in the center of the dry masa harina/salt mixture
- Pour hot water and oil into the well.
- Mix together until all of the water is absorbed.
- Use hands to bring the dough together into a large ball. The texture of the dough should be moist and bouncy, not dry and crumbly or wet and gooey. Think of a texture similar to children's play-dough.
- Place the large dough ball in the bowl and cover the top of the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel. Let it rest for approximately 20 minutes.
- Heat your griddle, skillet, or pan over medium-high heat.
- Divide the large dough ball into 12 equal pieces. Roll each section into a ball using your hands and put them back into the large bowl. Keep the bowl covered with plastic wrap or a towel so the dough stays moist.
- Cut the sides of a large plastic storage bag so that it is connected by only one seam (it should open like a book). If you have a tortiall press, open and place the plastic bag in it. If you do not, then set the plastic bag on a flat surface, like a cutting board.
- Set one of the small balls of dough into the center of the plastic bag. Lay the top of the plastic bag over the dough ball.
- If you are using a tortilla press, close it and flatten the dough ball in the plastic storage bag that is between the press plates. If you do not have a tortilla press, use a skillet, pan, or something similar to flatten the dough ball.
- Now you have an uncooked tortilla! Remove the flattened dough ball and carefully place it on the heated griddle, skillet, or pan. Cook for about 30 seconds. Flip and cook the other side for about 30 seconds. You will start to see the tortilla inflate and have darkened spots on it. 
- Note: If your tortillas are slightly thicker or thinner, cooking times will need to be adjusted accordingly.
- Place the cooked tortillas on a clean towel and fold the tower over to keep the tortialls warm.
- Repeat with remaining tortillas
-Serve immediately and enjoy!
