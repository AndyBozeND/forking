ingredients:
- 3 cups all purpose flour (plus more for dusting)
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter (room temperature)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest
- 3 tablespoons buttermilk
- 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

directions:
- In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cream of tatar, and salt.
- In a separate bowl beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, then add the egg and lemon zest and continue beating until the egg is completely incorprated.
- Beating on low speed, slowly add the flour mixture, and continue to beat until almost incorporated.
- Add the buttermilk and lemon juice, and beat together.
- Press the dough into a rough rectangle, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm (at least 1 hour or up to overnight).
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, and line the baking sheets with parchment paper.
- On a lightly floured work surface (not the baking sheets you just lined with parchment), using a floured rolling pin, roll out chilled dough until about 1/4 inch thick and use whatever shape cookie cutter you desire to cut out shapes.
- Place cut out shapes onto the prepped parchment covered baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart.
- Rinse and repeat until you are out of dough.
- Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are lightly goden around the edges but barely colored on top (roughly 12- 15 minutes).
- Let cool on sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to cooling racks where they can cool completely either for icing or eating. 
- Use whatever icing you want, I tend to use a basic powder sugar, milk, and vanilla mix to top mine, but use whatever you want, you do you.
