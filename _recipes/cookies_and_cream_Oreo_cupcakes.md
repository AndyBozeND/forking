components:
- Oreo cupcake
- Cream filling
- Buttercream frosting
- Decoration

ingredients for the batter:
- 125ml buttermilk (room temperature)
- 125ml cold coffee
- 105ml vegetable oil
- 2 small eggs (room temperature)
- 185g caster sugar
- 140g plain flour
- 35g black cocoa powder
- 40g semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1/4tsp salt
- 1/2tsp baking soda

directions for the batter:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
- Prepare a cupcake/muffin tin with cupcake foils. (Yield will be 12 cupcakes.)
- Whisk together your buttermilk, cold coffe, vegetable oil, and two small eggs.
- To your wet mixture, add sugar, sift in your flour and black cocoa powder, add chocolate chips, salt, and baking soda.
- Whisk to combine into a dark, fairly runny, chocolate batter.
- Pour into a jug or other pouring vessel with a spout. This will make filling your cupcake foils much easier!
- Pour a roughly equal amount of batter into each foil. Use a spoon to assist with the pouring, and to distribute the chocolate chips.
- Bake the cupcakes at 350 degrees for about 22 minutes or until the batter has set and springs back to the touch.
- Remove from the oven and cool completely.

ingredients for the cream filling:
- 100ml heavy whipping cream
- 1tsp powdered sugar

directions for the cream filling:
- Using a stand or hand mixer, whip 100ml heavy whipping cream and 1tsp powdered sugar until you have soft peaks. Do not over whip!
- When the cupcakes have completely cooled, use a cupcake or apple corer, or a small spoon, and remove the center of the cupcake from the top. Be careful not to go all the way through the cupcake, but make a healthy space for the whipped cream.
- Using a piping bag and standard nozzle, fill each cupcake with whipped cream.

ingredients for the buttercream frosting:
- 200g unsalted butter (softened)
- 320g powdered sugar (sifted)
- 75g crushed Oreo cookies (filling removed)

directions for the buttercream frosting:
- Using a stand or hand mixer, whip the unsalted butter until it has turned white in color and has a smooth, creamy consistency.
- Add the sifted powdered sugar bit by bit, mixing to combine each time.
- Add the Oreo crumbs and continue mixing until just combined.
- The frosting should be creamy and soft, and good piping consistency.
- Using a piping bag and a nozzle of your choice, frost each cupcake.

ingredients for decoration:
- 50g semi-sweet chocolate (melted)
- 6 Oreos, cut into quarters

directions for decoration:
- Using a bain-maire, heat the chocolate until melted and glossy.
- Using a small piping bag (no nozzle, just cut a very small hole) drizzle the melted chocolate over the top of each cupcake.
- Top each cupcake with two Oreo quarters.
