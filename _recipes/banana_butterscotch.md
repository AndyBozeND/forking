title:  "Banana and Butterscotch Loaf"
image: banana_b.jpg
tags: sweet treats

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 170 c, (150 for fanbake). Grease and line loaf tin.
- Mix together baking powder, baking soda and powder.
- In a larger bowl, beat the sugar and eggs (with beater if you've got one) until they are pale and fluffy. Stir in banana, yog, choc, I put the maple syrup in at this point, and 50g pecan nuts, followed by the flour mixture.
- Spoon into loaf tin and sprinkle with the remaining nuts and demerara sugar (I didn't do this). Bake for an hour, or until skewer comes out clean. Cool in the tin on a wire rack, turn out and slice.

components:
- 175g (6 oz) flour
- 2 tsp baking power
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 175g muscovado sugar (I have no idea what that is - I used brown sugar), I wanted to add a tbs of maple syrup - so swapped that in and put in 160g of sugar.
- 2 large eggs
- 3 medium-sized ripe bananas - mashed
- 150g natural yogurt
- 150g bar of butterscotch (good lucking finding that - I used Whittakers 50% dark)
- 100g pecan nuts - 50g for the bake and 50 for the top (I stuffed this up and just put 70g in the bake - no topping)
- 1-2 tbsp demerara sugar

Enjoy!!
