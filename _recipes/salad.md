ingredients:
- Cannellini Beans or Garbanzo Beans
- Olives
- Smoked Tofu
- Feta Cheese
- Fresh Italian Flat Leaf Parsley
- Vinegar and Olive Oil
- optional other additions tomatoes, capers, peas, green beans, etc.

directions:
- Start with 1 can (12 oz or 16 oz) of cannellini beans or garbanzo beans. Best to drain all the liquid. Recommend rinsing the beans.
- 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup (64 - 85 g) olives - Olives can be black, green, or Kalamata. We usually go with the Kalamata olives brined by the Greek Grocers who live close to us. Chop the olives in small pieces but not too small. Use some of the olive liquid for the dressing.
- 1/2 cup (64 g) of smoked tofu. Chop the smoked tofu into small cubed pieces. The smoked tofu makes the recipe strong as it is very distinct smoky flavor. We get it from a vendor at the Farmer's market - it is amazing but yes very pungent flavor.
- 1/2 cup (64 g) of feta cheese. Chop into small cubed pieces. A strong and salty feta really makes this dish and it stands up to the smoked tofu. You can leave this out if you want the dish to be vegan.
- 1/4 cup (32 g) of fresh Italian flat leaf parsley. Rough chop or use a scissors. The verdant leaves brighten this dish and the parsley carries the flavor to an amazing level. The dressing can be whatever you want or have on hand. I can suggest using some of the olive liquid, Italian seasoning (dried rosemary, basil, parsley, & oregano), Garlic powder, Red wine and/or Balsamic vinegar, and a must is good quality Olive Oil. Salt and Pepper.

A favorite when I go to BBQs (parties, hackathons, your folks' place), this red berry tart is fairly easy to make and packs a huge wow factor.
