tags: bread

directions:
- Rub some oil around a 1kg/2lb loaf tin, or insert a baking liner and pre-heat the oven.
- Put the flour into a large mixing bowl, add 150ml water and 2 spoons of the oil. Mix with a fork or pastry cutter to make fine breadcrumbs without any lumps.
- Measure the bicarbonate of soda, sugar, salt and Vitamin C (if used) into another bowl and stir to combine.
- Measure the yoghurt and 100ml water into a third bowl and mix well.
- Cover all the bowls and leave them in a warm place for 20 minutes.
- Sieve the prepared soda mix onto the prepared flour and mix again with a fork, breaking up any lumps.
- If using lemon juice, add it to the prepared yoghurt, stir and add everything to the flour bowl.
- Continue stirring until all the flour is combined and forms a thick batter.
- Drizzle the remaining oil over the sticky batter/dough and turn the mixture a couple of times in the bowl to encourage the formation of a doughy mass.
- Tip the dough onto the prepared tin and smooth the top.
- Put the bread into the hot oven, close the door and reduce the temperature immediately to the lower heat.
- Bake for 60 minutes.
- Turn the loaf out onto a wire rack. The bottom should sound hollow when tapped.
- Cool completely before slicing.
