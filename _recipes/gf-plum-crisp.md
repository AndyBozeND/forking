Ingredients:
- 2 pounds plums, pitted, and halved or quartered
- 1/2 cup cane sugar
- 2 tablespoons corn starch
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest, plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 cups ground gluten-free oats or store-bought oat flour
- 2 tablespoons corn meal
- 3/4 cup cane sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees Butter a 9 x 9-inch baking dish and set aside.
- In a large bowl, gently toss plums with sugar, corn starch, sea salt, and lemon zest and juice, and set aside.
- If making your own oat flour, grind oats on high in the bowl of a food processor or in batches in a coffee grinder until mixture is relatively smooth and flour-like. In a medium bowl, combine oat flour, cornmeal, sugar, and sea salt. - Add butter, and rub into oat mixture with fingertips until mixture has a sandy, clumpy texture and is well combined.
- Spoon plum filling into prepared baking dish. Top with oat mixture. Bake 40 - 45 minutes, or until crisp topping is golden and filling is bubbling vigorously.
- Serve, warm or at room temperature, with vanilla ice cream.
