ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed meal (or can use 2 eggs if not vegan)
- 2 cups rolled oats 
- 1/2 cup unsweetened shredded or flaked coconut
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup any nut butter (creamy will hold the cookies together best, but use whatever you have)
- 1/4 to 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
- 1/2 cup dried fruit, such as cranberries, chopped apricots, or raisins
- 1/3 cup hemp seeds or chia seeds
1/2 cup pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds, chopped (optional)

directions:
- Stir together the ground flaxseed meal with 5 tablespoons warm water. Let sit for 15 minutes to gel together. 
- Preheat the oven to 350ºF/175ºC. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat
- In a medium bowl, mix together the wet ingredients: flaxseed mixture, nut butter, maple syrup, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth.
- Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients: oats, coconut, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. 
- Stir until well mixed. Add a tablespoon or two of water if it doesn’t hold together well.
- Fold in your desired mix-ins (fruits and seeds). If the dough is too sticky to handle, refrigerate it for 10-15 minutes to firm up slightly.
- Scoop about 3 tablespoons of dough per cookie onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1/2 inch apart. Lightly flatten the top of each cookie with your hands or a fork. (note that this makes big cookies! Feel free to make them smaller and bake for a shorter amount of time.)
- Bake the cookies at 350 for 18-20 minutes. 
- Cool on pan 5 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack. 
- Store cookies in an airtight container or resealable bag on the counter for 2-3 days.
