ingredients:
- Beef, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds, garlic,  ginger, ground black pepper and sesame oil

directions:
- Take the meat out from the packaging.
- Slice the meat thinly across the grain. Ideal thickness is 2mm to 3mm (1/8 inch). Now the meat is ready to be marinated with bulgogi sauce!
- Make bulgogi sauce
- It has a blend of soy sauce, brown sugar, asian pear (or red apple), garlic, ginger, ground black pepper and sesame oil. This gives a slightly salty, mildly sweet and nutty savory flavor.

- Serve the bulgogi with some steamed rice
- Enjoy!!!
