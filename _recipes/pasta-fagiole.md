ingredients:
- 1 (15.5 oz) can Goya small white beans, undrained
- 1/2 (8 oz.) can tomato sauce
- 3 large cloves of fresh garlic , chopped
- 1 tbsp . chopped fresh , Italian flat-leaf parsley
- 1/2 cup (+/-) olive oil
- 1/2 cup coarsely chopped celery
- 1 cup (+/-) light & fat free chicken broth
- 1/2 lb . tubettini pasta

directions:
- Saute garlic, parsley and celery in olive oil, on low flame, until celery is lightly translucent.
- Add undrained beans, tomato sauce, and chicken broth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Simmer on low for about an hour.  In a separate pot, boil 1/2 lb. tubettini pasta for approx. 6 minutes (note: the pasta will be firm and undercooked).  Drain pasta completely and add to bean mixture.  Add additional chicken broth, as necessary, to keep soup from getting too thick.
- Continue to simmer on low until pasta is cooked to taste.  Although I like it "as is", go ahead and sprinkle on a teaspoon or two of parmesan cheese!
