ingredients:
- 1 cup chickpea flour
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 1 tsp carom seeds
- 1 tsp chilli powder
- 1.5 cup round sliced potatoes
- 1.25 cups water

directions:
- Add chilli powder, carom seeds, and salt to the chickpea flour. Mix all these dry ingredients. Add water to this mixture to form a smooth semi thick batter. Stir well. Batter should not be too thick or too thin/flowy. Let the batter sit for two minutes.
- While the air fryer is getting prepped, put the sliced potatoes slices in room temperature water in a bowl. Peeled and sliced potatoes tends to turn black if left as is. We do not want the potatoes to turn black.
- For the air fryer, grease/spray all the walls and base of the air fryer basket with olive oil.
Set the air fryer basket for pre-heating at 375 degrees F for 15 mins. 
While the air fryer is pre-heating, take each potato slice and put it in the batter one by one. Coat all the slices nicely with the batter. 
As soon as the air fryer is preheated remove the air fryer basket and arrange all the coated potato slices one by one in the basket. Make sure the slices don't overlap.
Halfway through the 15 minutes of air frying, turn/flip the potato slices, so that they can be air fried on the other side as well. Air fryer will indicate when to flip the slices.  
After 15 minutes of air frying, crispy potato fritters will be ready to serve! 
Enjoy the fritters with just ketchup or with a dip of your choice!
