ingredients:
- 1 cup (250 ml) unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon (5 ml) baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) baking soda
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup (180 ml) brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons (45 ml) cocoa powder
- 3 tablespoons (45 ml) cocoa powder
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup (250 ml) ripe bananas mashed with a fork (about 2 bananas)
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) milk
- 3/4 cup (180 ml) chocolate chips (dark chocolate is my favorite)
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) walnut or pecans (coarsely chopped)

directions:
- With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 180 °C (350 °F). Line a 23 x 13-cm (9 x 5-inch) loaf pan with a strip of parchment paper, letting it hang over both sides. Butter the other two sides.
- In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Set aside.
- In another bowl, cream the butter with the brown sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla with an electric mixer. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until smooth.
- On low speed, add the bananas and dry ingredients alternately with the milk. Add the chocolate and combine. Pour into the prepared pan and sprinkle with the nuts.
- Bake for about 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean but slightly topped with melted chocolate. Let cool for at least 1 hour and unmould. Serve warm or cold.
