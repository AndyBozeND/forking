title: "Filipino Chicken Adobo"
image: chicken-adobo.jpg

ingredients:
- Chicken, preferably dark meat 
- Soy Sauce (Filipino brands or Asian brands)
- White Vinegar
- Garlic Cloves
- Whole Bay Leaves, dried
- Whole Black Peppercorns

directions:
- The amount of ingredients you use depends on how much chicken you intend to make. So, let's say you're making 8 thigh pieces. Throw those in a sauce pan or stock pot on a stovetop burner. Take equal parts soy sauce and white vinegar and pour these liquids into your cookware in 1/2 cup increments until chicken is 3/4 to 4/5 submerged. Throw in 3 or 4 whole bay leaves. Take about 8 to 10 garlic cloves, crush them, and throw them in as well. Measure out about a teaspoon or teaspoon and a half of whole black peppercorns. Sprinkle them over the chicken. Bring this all to a boil over medium heat. When boiling starts, cover your pot or pan, and turn heat to low. Then wait until the chicken is cooked, about 35-40 minutes, but you can leave it on low heat forever, as if you were using a slow cooker (which, of course, is an alternate way to cook this, and will take 6-8 hours). The longer you slow-cook, the more masarap (tagalog for 'tasty').

- Serve with steamed rice.

- You can also add stewing pork. For lower sodium, add 1/3 to 1/2 cup water, or more, to taste. But don't use low-sodium soy sauce.
