ingredients:
    - 5 cups flour
    - 1 3/4 tsp salt
    - 1 tsp baking powder
    - 1 lb tenderflake lard
    - 1 egg
    - 3/4 cup 7Up

directions:
    - Mix the flour, salt and baking powder in a large mixing bowl. 
    - Cut the Tenderflake into slices (approximately 1.5 inch thickness). Add one slice into the flour mixture and cut it into smaller pieces to  blend into the flour. Do the same for the remaining slices of Tenderflake until you have used all of it and the mixture is crumbly
    - In a separate bowl, add the 7Up and the egg. Beat the egg until it is mixed into the 7Up.
    - Pour the 7Up mix into the flour/Tenderflake bowl and mix by hand until the dough holds together.
    - Roll the dough out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Use flour as needed on the rolling pin to prevent sticking. 
    - Place dough onto a pie plate and press it down so that it covers the bottom and sides of the plate.
    - Use a knife to trim off excess dough. 
    - Pour preferred pie filling into the pie plate.
    - If you are adding a top crust to the pie, roll out more pastry. Use water to moisten the edges of the pie pastry on the plate and add the top layer, pressing both layers together to seal the pie. Score the top layer to allow the steam to escape during baking. For a sweet pie, brush the top pastry layer with an egg white. For a savoury crust, brush it with an egg yolk. 
    - Bake the pie at 450F for 10 minutes, then lower to 375F for 40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is fully cooked.

Based on [old family recipe]. If any unused pastry remains, roll it out, spread a thin layer of butter over the remaining pastry and sprinkle brown sugar on top of the butter. Roll the dough into a log and cut into 1/2 inch thick pinwheels. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and bake the pinwheels at 350F for 20 minutes or until golden brown to make "Pets-de-soeurs."
