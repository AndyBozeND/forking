title:  "Hoshigaki (Dried Persimmons)"
image: hoshigaki.jpg
tags: fruit, Japanese

ingredients:
- ripe persimmons, preferably with stems
- kitchen twine
- small screws
- sunlit area to hang persimmons

directions:
- Remove the skin from the persimmons, leaving the stem and leaves on top.
- If there is no stem, insert a screw at the top of the persimmon.
- Tie the stem or screw to the kitchen twine. Some people like to tie several persimmons to one long piece of twine; others like to tie one or two persimmons to a shorter string. This will largely depend on the space available to hang.
- Hang the tied persimmons in a place that gets lots of sunlight.
- Once a week, squeeze the persimmons to concentrate the sugars inside the fruit.
- After 3-4 weeks, the hoshigaki should be dried and ready to eat.

Hoshigaki is the Japanese word for dried persimmons. This recipe shows the traditional way of air-drying them.
The photo shows the hoshigaki in their first week. I hope to update the photo to show the end result.
